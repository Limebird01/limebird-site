# Sprint Plan: Site Simplification and Stabilization (2024-07-22)

## What is the simplest way to achieve the goals?

**Recommended Path:**
1. **Stop using the App Router and Contentlayer/MDX entirely.**
2. **Move all content pages to the classic `pages/` directory as static `.tsx` files.**
   - Copy/paste content from MDX files into new `.tsx` pages.
   - Use simple React components for content; avoid dynamic imports or advanced features.
3. **Delete all Contentlayer, MDX, and App Router-specific config and dependencies.**
4. **Update navigation and links to use the new static pages.**
5. **Test the site after each change to ensure stability.**
6. **Document the new workflow for content updates (edit `.tsx` files in `pages/`).**

*Note: All code changes in this migration will be made by the AI assistant as directed by the project owner.*

**Deployment, build, and clean scripts (e.g., `deploy-dev.ps1`, `build-local.ps1`, `cleanup-dev.ps1`) should be retained as part of the project infrastructure, but may be updated as needed to support the new site architecture, systems, and tools.**

## Migration Checklist (Status as of 2024-07-23)

- [x] **Backup**
  - [x] Ensure all current code and content is committed and pushed to git.
  - [x] Create a backup branch (e.g., `legacy-app-router`) for reference.

- [x] **Dependency & Config Cleanup**
  - [x] List and remove all Contentlayer, MDX, and App Router-related dependencies from `package.json`.
  - [x] Delete or archive config files: `contentlayer.config.js`, MDX plugins, and related files.
  - [x] Remove any custom scripts or npm commands related to the old stack.

- [x] **Content Migration**
  - [x] Create a new `pages/` directory if it doesn't exist.
  - [x] For each MDX content page:
    - [x] Create a new `.tsx` file in `pages/` (e.g., `pages/services.tsx`).
    - [x] Copy content from the MDX file and convert to JSX/TSX as needed.
    - [x] Use simple functional React components for layout/content.
  - [x] Delete or archive the original MDX files.

- [x] **Route & Navigation Update**
  - [x] Remove or refactor dynamic App Router routes in `app/`.
  - [x] Update navigation components to link to the new static pages in `pages/`.

## Goal
Transition the project from a complex, hard-to-maintain stack (Next.js App Router + Contentlayer + MDX) to a simpler, more stable, and maintainable system that allows for efficient content updates and minimal troubleshooting.

## Objectives
- Remove or disable experimental/complex features and dependencies.
- Restore or migrate to a simpler architecture (e.g., Next.js Pages Router, static `.tsx` pages, or plain Markdown).
- Ensure the site is easy to update and maintain.
- Document options for future architecture.

## Tasks

### A. Cleanup and Decomplexification
- [ ] List all dependencies in `package.json` and identify those related to Contentlayer, MDX, and App Router.
- [ ] Remove Contentlayer, MDX, and related config files (e.g., `contentlayer.config.js`, MDX plugins, etc.).
- [ ] Delete or archive all MDX content files.
- [ ] Remove or refactor dynamic App Router routes (in `app/`) to static `.tsx` pages in `pages/`.
- [ ] Update or remove scripts and documentation referencing the old stack.
- [ ] Test the site for stability after each change (run locally and check all routes).

### B. Migration Options (Detailed)
- [ ] Create a new `pages/` directory if it doesn't exist.
- [ ] For each content page (e.g., services, products, about):
    - [ ] Create a new `.tsx` file in `pages/` (e.g., `pages/services.tsx`).
    - [ ] Copy content from the corresponding MDX file and convert to JSX/TSX as needed.
    - [ ] Use simple functional React components for layout/content.
- [ ] Update navigation components to link to the new static pages.
- [ ] Remove all references to dynamic routing and Contentlayer data fetching.
- [ ] (Optional) If Markdown is still desired, use a minimal loader or just copy/paste content as plain text/JSX.
- [ ] Document pros/cons of each approach for the project owner.

### C. Documentation
- [ ] Update CONOPS and README to reflect new priorities and architecture.
- [ ] Provide a simple guide for content updates in the new system ("Edit the appropriate `.tsx` file in `pages/` to update content").
- [ ] Document any manual steps required for migration (e.g., how to convert MDX to TSX, what to delete, etc.).

### D. Next Steps & Decision Points
- [ ] Present migration options and recommendations to project owner (summarize in a decision document).
- [ ] Decide on the new architecture and begin implementation.
- [ ] Set up a checklist for post-migration testing and verification.

## Deliverables
- Clean, stable codebase with minimal dependencies.
- Clear documentation for future maintenance and content updates.
- A decision document outlining the chosen path forward.
- A working site using the classic Next.js Pages Router and static `.tsx` pages for content.

## How to Fix

1. **Edit `limebird-site-new/next.config.mjs`**
   - Remove any lines that import or use `next-contentlayer`.
   - Typically, you’ll see something like:
     ```js
     import { withContentlayer } from "next-contentlayer";
     ```
     and
     ```js
     export default withContentlayer(nextConfig);
     ```
   - Change it to a plain export:
     ```js
     /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
     const nextConfig = {
       // ...your config here
     };

     export default nextConfig;
     ```

2. **Save the file.**

3. **Try running the dev server again:**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

---

**If you want, I can make this edit for you—just let me know!**  
Once you’ve made the change, your dev server should start without the Contentlayer error.

## What Matters for Navigation

The most important thing for your migration is the **navigation tests** (not the homepage accessibility or visual snapshot tests).  
To help you further, I need the **specific error message for the first failing navigation test** (e.g., "should navigate to Services page from main nav"). Cypress will show something like:

```
1) Navigation links
     Main navigation (desktop)
       should navigate to Services page from main nav:
     AssertionError: Timed out retrying: Expected to find element: 'nav', but never found it.
```
or
```
AssertionError: Timed out retrying: Expected to find content: 'Services', but never found it.
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Scroll up in your Cypress output** and find the error message for the first failing navigation test.
2. **Copy and paste that error message here.**

---

This will help me pinpoint whether:
- The test can’t find the `<nav>` element,
- The link text doesn’t match,
- Or there’s another issue.

Once I have that info, I’ll give you a precise fix! 

---

## Why This Happened

- The navigation component (`MainNav`) may not be included in your homepage (marketing landing page) layout.
- Or, the navigation is conditionally rendered and the condition is not met.
- Or, the navigation items array is empty or not passed to the component.

---

## How to Fix

### 1. **Ensure the Navigation Component Is Rendered**

- Open your main layout file for the marketing group, likely `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` or the global `app/layout.tsx`.
- Make sure the `MainNav` component is included at the top of the page, e.g.:
  ```tsx
  import { MainNav } from "@/components/main-nav";
  import { marketingConfig } from "@/config/marketing";

  export default function MarketingLayout({ children }) {
    return (
      <>
        <MainNav items={marketingConfig.mainNav} />
        {children}
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

### 2. **Pass the Navigation Items**

- Make sure you are passing the `items` prop to `MainNav`:
  ```tsx
  <MainNav items={marketingConfig.mainNav} />
  ```

### 3. **Check the Navigation Items Array**

- Ensure `marketingConfig.mainNav` contains the correct links (Services, Products, Terms, Privacy).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add the navigation component to your layout as shown above.**
2. **Save and restart your dev server.**
3. **Reload the homepage and confirm the navigation links are visible.**
4. **Rerun your Cypress tests.**

---

Would you like me to make this edit for you? If so, please confirm which layout file you want the navigation added to (e.g., `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` or `app/layout.tsx`).

## Migration Progress Log (2024-07-23)

### Navigation and Layout Fixes
- Updated `MainNav` to ensure each link uses its own `href` and removed segment logic.
- Verified and corrected all navigation items in `marketingConfig.mainNav`.
- Ensured all static pages (`services.tsx`, `products.tsx`, `terms.tsx`, `privacy.tsx`) have unique `<h1>` headings matching their navigation link text.
- Added `SiteFooter` to the marketing layout so the footer is present on all marketing pages.
- Confirmed navigation links are visible and functional on all pages.

### Testing
- Ran Cypress E2E tests for navigation and layout.
- 10 out of 13 navigation tests now passing; remaining issues were fixed by updating the MainNav component.
- After fixes, all navigation and footer/mobile nav tests pass.
- Some homepage accessibility/visual snapshot tests still fail (to be addressed separately).

#### Current Test Failures (as of 2024-07-23)
- **Homepage accessibility test (`checkA11y`)**: Fails with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`.
- **Homepage visual snapshot test**: Fails with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`.
- **Homepage responsive test**: Fails with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`.
- **All navigation and content tests now pass.**
- These failures are likely due to a plugin or test misconfiguration (e.g., axe-core, Percy, or Cypress setup) and can be addressed in a follow-up task.

#### Milestone (2024-07-23)
- **All navigation and content tests now pass in Cypress.**
- **Migration to a simpler, more stable architecture is complete.**
- Remaining Cypress failures are limited to homepage accessibility and visual snapshot tests (to be addressed separately).
- Local commits are up to date; `git push` failed but will be resolved later.

### Commit
- All changes staged and committed locally with message: `fix nav`.
- Includes navigation fixes, layout and heading updates, removal of old MDX/Contentlayer files, addition of new static pages, and Cypress tests.

### Next Steps
- (Optional) Push to remote repository for backup and collaboration.
- (Optional) Deploy to dev or production environment.
- Update documentation (README, CONOPS) to reflect new architecture and workflow.
- Address any remaining test failures (e.g., homepage accessibility/visual snapshot).

## Upcoming Task: Comprehensive Blog Functionality

- A full-featured blog (with posts, categories, tags, author pages, etc.) is required for the site.
- The team will evaluate and potentially integrate a purpose-built blog template (e.g., Next.js blog starter, Astro blog, Hugo, etc.) as a future task.
- This will be handled as a separate project or integration, allowing for faster setup, best practices, and easier upgrades without impacting the stability of the main site.
- Once a template is selected, the blog will be integrated into the monorepo or deployed as a separate app, and navigation will be updated accordingly.

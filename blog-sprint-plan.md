## Build Status and Upgrade Rationale (2024-07-23)

- The project builds and compiles successfully on Next.js 14.x, with only minor linter warnings and no fatal errors or type issues.
- Previous attempts to upgrade to Next.js 15.x resulted in a build-blocking type generation bug for dynamic routes, which is not present in 14.x.
- **Rationale:** Remain on Next.js 14.x for stability and maintainability until the type generation bug in 15.x is resolved upstream. This decision should be referenced for any future upgrade considerations.

### New Sprint Tasks (2024-07-24)

- Implement full output logging for all test tools in build and deploy scripts (capture stdout/stderr to log files, add section headers, document log locations).
- Always run test suites/scripts in the foreground or log output to files.
- Improve cleanup-dev.ps1 reliability: add timeouts, robust try/catch, always call summary/exit, never kill self, forced exit at end.

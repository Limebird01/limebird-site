### Issue #2: Netlify Branch Deployment Configuration
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Description:** Only one deployment can be published at a time in Netlify  
**Root Cause:** Free plan limitation - Netlify free tier only allows one published deployment at a time

**Steps to Reproduce:** 
1. Publish dev branch deployment
2. Production deployment becomes unpublished
3. Publish production deployment
4. Dev branch deployment becomes unpublished
5. Only one deployment can be "published" at a time

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ **Production:** main branch ‚Üí limebird.org (published)
- ‚úÖ **Development:** dev branch ‚Üí dev.limebird.org (published)
- ‚úÖ **Both environments** working independently

**Current Behavior:**
- ‚ùå **Only one deployment** can be published at a time (free plan limitation)
- ‚ùå **Publishing one** unpublishes the other
- ‚ùå **No independent environments** for production and development

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- [x] Identify that only one deployment can be published
- [x] Confirm dev branch deployment is working at dev--limebirdorg.netlify.app
- [x] Verify DNS configuration is correct (dev.limebird.org ‚Üí dev--limebirdorg.netlify.app)
- [x] Discover this is a free plan limitation
- [x] Accept limitation and implement workaround
- [x] Test workaround functionality

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Accepted free plan limitation and implemented workaround

**Workaround Solution:**
- ‚úÖ **Production:** limebird.org ‚Üí Main branch (published)
- ‚úÖ **Development:** https://dev--limebirdorg.netlify.app/ ‚Üí Dev branch (accessible via direct URL)
- ‚úÖ **DNS:** dev.limebird.org ‚Üí dev--limebirdorg.netlify.app (works when dev is temporarily published)

**Notes:** This is a Netlify free plan limitation, not a configuration issue. The dev branch deployment is working correctly at the direct URL. Workaround: Use direct dev URL for development, keep main branch published for production, and temporarily publish dev branch when needed for dev.limebird.org testing.

**Accepted Solution:**
- **Accept limitation** and use direct dev URL for development
- **Switch between** published deployments as needed
- **Document workaround** in deployment guide
- **Consider upgrade** to paid plan in future if needed

**Resolution Date:** 2025-01-15

### Issue #1: Gmail "Send Mail As" Configuration
**Date:** 2025-07-19  
**Status:** üîÑ In Progress  
**Description:** support@limebird.org sending as wrong email address  
**Root Cause:** SimpleLogin.com incorrectly involved - should not be in the email flow

**Steps to Reproduce:** 
1. Compose email in Gmail
2. Select "From: support@limebird.org"
3. Send email
4. SimpleLogin blocks the attempt (should not be involved)

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- [x] Check Gmail "Send mail as" settings for support@limebird.org
- [x] Verify SMTP configuration is correct
- [x] Re-verify email address in Gmail
- [x] Check SimpleLogin service settings
- [x] Remove SimpleLogin from support@limebird.org email flow
- [x] Check Hover email forwarding setup
- [x] Ensure direct Hover ‚Üí Gmail forwarding for support@limebird.org
- [ ] Test email sending after removing SimpleLogin

**Resolution:** üîÑ PENDING - SimpleLogin alias deleted but issue persists - need further investigation

**Notes:** SimpleLogin should not be involved with support@limebird.org at all

**NEW DISCOVERY:** 4th email address `evelynneoga@gmail.com` is the owner of SimpleLogin alias `danandeve.btpbd@simplelogin.com` - this explains why limebird73@gmail.com is being blocked

**NEW INVESTIGATION:** Need to check evelynneoga@gmail.com Gmail "Send Mail As" settings for any support@limebird.org configurations that might be causing conflicts

**Update:** Email now appears broken after third-party service deletion

**Latest:** **ROOT CAUSE FOUND** - SimpleLogin intercepting support@limebird.org emails and converting to danandeve.btpbd@simplelogin.com, then blocking because limebird73@gmail.com is not the owner

**Important:** dan@limebird.org is/was functioning fine and was tested - use as reference for working configuration

**Date:** 2025-07-19  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Description:** Multiple syntax errors in deployment scripts  
**Root Cause:** Missing braces, string terminators, and PowerShell syntax issues

**Resolution:** Created simplified deploy-simple.ps1 script with proper syntax and logging

**Files Fixed:**
- deploy.ps1 (deleted - too complex)
- deploy.bat (deleted - outdated)
- deploy-working.ps1 (deleted - syntax errors)

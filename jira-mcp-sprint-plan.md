## 🚀 **Current Status & Decision Point**

### **✅ Completed Tasks:**
- [x] **Create Jira Cloud account** (Limebird73@gmail.com)
- [x] **Set up project administrator access**
- [x] **Create "Limebird.org" project** (SCRUM)
- [x] **Configure issue types** (Epic, Bug, Feature, Task)

- **Issue Types:** Epic, Bug, Feature, Task
- **Labels:** Tools, Documentation, Blog, Website
- **Account:** Limebird73@gmail.com
- **Instance:** limebird.atlassian.net

### **🎯 Decision Point: MCP Server Integration**

**Research Findings:**
- ❌ **No official Jira MCP server** available
- ❌ **Custom MCP server** would require significant development time
- ❌ **MCP technology** still emerging, no official Jira support yet

**Options:**

#### **Option 1: Skip MCP, Stick with Markdown Planning**
- ✅ **Current workflow works efficiently**
- ✅ **No setup time required**
- ✅ **Focus on actual development**
- ✅ **Proven and reliable approach**
- ❌ **Manual Jira work required**
- ❌ **No AI automation for Jira**

#### **Option 2: Build Custom MCP Server**
- ✅ **AI-powered Jira management**
- ✅ **Cutting-edge technology learning**
- ✅ **Future-proof solution**
- ❌ **Complex setup and development time**
- ❌ **Uncertain outcome and reliability**
- ❌ **Takes focus away from actual project**

#### **Option 3: Abandon Jira, Use Markdown Only**
- ✅ **Simplest approach**
- ✅ **No tool overhead**
- ✅ **Focus entirely on development**
- ❌ **No visual project management**
- ❌ **No sprint tracking**

### **💡 Recommendation:**
**Skip MCP for now and stick with markdown planning.** 

**Reasons:**
1. **Current workflow is efficient** - We're productive with markdown
2. **Focus on actual development** - Build features instead of tools
3. **MCP is still emerging** - Wait for official Jira support
4. **Can always add later** - When official servers are available

### **✅ Next Steps (After Decision):**
1. **Complete Jira setup** (if keeping Jira)
2. **Focus on blog subdomain** development
3. **Work on actual features** and improvements
4. **Update project documentation**
